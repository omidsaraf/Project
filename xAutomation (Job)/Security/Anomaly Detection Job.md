### Step-by-Step to Create the Anomaly Detection Job

1. **Configure Database Mail**:
   - Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
   - Expand the server node, right-click on `Database Mail`, and select `Configure Database Mail`.
   - Follow the wizard to set up a new Database Mail profile and account.

2. **Create an Operator**:
   - In SSMS, expand the `SQL Server Agent` node.
   - Right-click on `Operators` and select `New Operator`.
   - Enter the operator's name and email address. This operator will receive the email notifications.

3. **Create a Table to Log Access Attempts**:
   - Create a table to log access attempts to the data warehouse.
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE AccessAttemptsLog (
       AttemptID INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
       UserName NVARCHAR(100),
       AttemptTime DATETIME,
       Success BIT
   );
   ```

4. **Create a Stored Procedure to Log Access Attempts**:
   ```sql
   CREATE PROCEDURE LogAccessAttempt
       @UserName NVARCHAR(100),
       @Success BIT
   AS
   BEGIN
       INSERT INTO AccessAttemptsLog (UserName, AttemptTime, Success)
       VALUES (@UserName, GETDATE(), @Success);
   END;
   ```

5. **Create a Job to Detect Anomalies**:
   - Right-click on `Jobs` under the `SQL Server Agent` node and select `New Job`.
   - In the `New Job` window, provide a name for the job (e.g., `Access Denied Anomaly Detection`).

6. **Add Job Steps**:
   - Go to the `Steps` page and click `New`.
   - Create a step to check for three consecutive access denied attempts.
   ```sql
   DECLARE @UserName NVARCHAR(100);
   SELECT TOP 1 @UserName = UserName
   FROM AccessAttemptsLog
   WHERE Success = 0
   ORDER BY AttemptTime DESC;

   IF (SELECT COUNT(*) 
       FROM AccessAttemptsLog 
       WHERE UserName = @UserName 
       AND Success = 0 
       AND AttemptTime > DATEADD(MINUTE, -10, GETDATE())) >= 3
   BEGIN
       EXEC msdb.dbo.sp_send_dbmail
           @profile_name = 'YourMailProfile',
           @recipients = 'admin@example.com',
           @subject = 'Access Denied Alert',
           @body = 'There have been three consecutive access denied attempts to the northwind_DW data warehouse.',
           @query = 'SELECT * FROM AccessAttemptsLog WHERE UserName = @UserName AND Success = 0 AND AttemptTime > DATEADD(MINUTE, -10, GETDATE())';
   END;
   ```

7. **Schedule the Job**:
   - Go to the `Schedules` page and click `New`.
   - Set up the schedule to run the job at regular intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes).
