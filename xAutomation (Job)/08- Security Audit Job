1. **Configure Database Mail**:
   - Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
   - Expand the server node, right-click on `Database Mail`, and select `Configure Database Mail`.
   - Follow the wizard to set up a new Database Mail profile and account.

2. **Create an Operator**:
   - In SSMS, expand the `SQL Server Agent` node.
   - Right-click on `Operators` and select `New Operator`.
   - Enter the operator's name and email address. This operator will receive the email notifications.

3. **Create a Security Audit Job**:
   - Right-click on `Jobs` under the `SQL Server Agent` node and select `New Job`.
   - In the `New Job` window, provide a name for the job (e.g., `Security Audit Job`).

4. **Add Job Steps**:
   - Go to the `Steps` page and click `New`.
   - Create a step to audit changes to SQL Server Agent jobs.
   ```sql
   -- Step 1: Audit Job Changes
   SELECT j.name AS JobName, 
          l.name AS JobOwner, 
          j.date_created, 
          j.date_modified
   INTO AuditJobChanges
   FROM msdb.dbo.sysjobs AS j
   JOIN sys.server_principals AS l ON j.owner_sid = l.sid
   WHERE j.date_created > DATEADD(DAY, -1, GETDATE())
      OR j.date_modified > DATEADD(DAY, -1, GETDATE());
   ```

5. **Add a Step for Access Attempt Logging**:
   - Create a step to log access attempts to the data warehouse.
   ```sql
   -- Step 2: Log Access Attempts
   INSERT INTO AccessAttemptsLog (UserName, AttemptTime, Success)
   SELECT suser_sname(), GETDATE(), 0
   WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM AccessAttemptsLog WHERE UserName = suser_sname() AND Success = 1);
   ```

6. **Add a Step for Anomaly Detection**:
   - Create a step to detect anomalies, such as three consecutive access denied attempts.
   ```sql
   -- Step 3: Anomaly Detection
   DECLARE @UserName NVARCHAR(100);
   SELECT TOP 1 @UserName = UserName
   FROM AccessAttemptsLog
   WHERE Success = 0
   ORDER BY AttemptTime DESC;

   IF (SELECT COUNT(*) 
       FROM AccessAttemptsLog 
       WHERE UserName = @UserName 
       AND Success = 0 
       AND AttemptTime > DATEADD(MINUTE, -10, GETDATE())) >= 3
   BEGIN
       EXEC msdb.dbo.sp_send_dbmail
           @profile_name = 'YourMailProfile',
           @recipients = 'admin@example.com',
           @subject = 'Access Denied Alert',
           @body = 'There have been three consecutive access denied attempts to the northwind_DW data warehouse.',
           @query = 'SELECT * FROM AccessAttemptsLog WHERE UserName = @UserName AND Success = 0 AND AttemptTime > DATEADD(MINUTE, -10, GETDATE())';
   END;
   ```

7. **Schedule the Job**:
   - Go to the `Schedules` page and click `New`.
   - Set up the schedule to run the job at regular intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes).

8. **Enable Notifications**:
   - Go to the `Notifications` page.
   - Check the `E-mail` option and select the operator you created earlier.
   - Set the condition to `When the job fails`.

### Example Job Configuration

Hereâ€™s an example of the SQL script used in the job steps:

```sql
-- Step 1: Audit Job Changes
SELECT j.name AS JobName, 
       l.name AS JobOwner, 
       j.date_created, 
       j.date_modified
INTO AuditJobChanges
FROM msdb.dbo.sysjobs AS j
JOIN sys.server_principals AS l ON j.owner_sid = l.sid
WHERE j.date_created > DATEADD(DAY, -1, GETDATE())
   OR j.date_modified > DATEADD(DAY, -1, GETDATE());

-- Step 2: Log Access Attempts
INSERT INTO AccessAttemptsLog (UserName, AttemptTime, Success)
SELECT suser_sname(), GETDATE(), 0
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM AccessAttemptsLog WHERE UserName = suser_sname() AND Success = 1);

-- Step 3: Anomaly Detection
DECLARE @UserName NVARCHAR(100);
SELECT TOP 1 @UserName = UserName
FROM AccessAttemptsLog
WHERE Success = 0
ORDER BY AttemptTime DESC;

IF (SELECT COUNT(*) 
    FROM AccessAttemptsLog 
    WHERE UserName = @UserName 
    AND Success = 0 
    AND AttemptTime > DATEADD(MINUTE, -10, GETDATE())) >= 3
BEGIN
    EXEC msdb.dbo.sp_send_dbmail
        @profile_name = 'YourMailProfile',
        @recipients = 'admin@example.com',
        @subject = 'Access Denied Alert',
        @body = 'There have been three consecutive access denied attempts to the northwind_DW data warehouse.',
        @query = 'SELECT * FROM AccessAttemptsLog WHERE UserName = @UserName AND Success = 0 AND AttemptTime > DATEADD(MINUTE, -10, GETDATE())';
END;
```
