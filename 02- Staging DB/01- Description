**ETL Setting Database as a Bridge Between OLTP and DW:**

1. **Staging Tables**: The ETL Setting database includes staging tables to facilitate the loading and transformation of data.
2. **Detect Changes**: If CDC (Change Data Capture) is not available in OLTP, create tables to detect changes.
3. **Views with Union All**: Create views using `Union All` to record changes.
4. **Incremental Load Connections**: Establish connections for incremental loading to avoid truncating and reloading tables constantly. Only apply recent changes to Fact tables.

This approach ensures efficient data loading and transformation between OLTP and Data Warehouse (DW) systems.
